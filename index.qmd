# Preface {.unnumbered}

The Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE) is a critical infrastructure supporting data generated by NIH Common Fund programs. 
As the volume of biomedical data grows, there is an increasing need for systems that not only store data but also facilitate its effective use by researchers, clinicians, and policymakers.

This report examines the metrics that can quantify the impact, significance, value, and costs of the CFDE. 
These metrics are essential for evaluating the ecosystem's contributions, including its role in advancing scientific research and collaboration, as well as its broader economic and social effects.

The proposed framework includes both qualitative and quantitative assessments to address the challenges of measuring a complex and evolving system like the CFDE. 
By establishing clear metrics, this report aims to provide a basis for evaluating the performance of the CFDE and informing decisions about its future development and sustainability.
